# Full Stack Developer interview assignment

Welcome. We need to make enhancements to an existing stock ticker application written in ASP.NET Core.

Your first task is to create a webpage that will call a web API endpoint to get latest stock prices and then display them. The list of stocks and corresponding prices should update on the webpage at a regular interval. Feel free to build this webpage using any technology and programming language you are comfortable using. **This is not a memory test** - you may refer to online documentation to get the job done.

Your next task is to create a web API endpoint to add new stocks.

Please try to keep the solution to under an hour. If time is short, only focus on the first task.

Good luck!
